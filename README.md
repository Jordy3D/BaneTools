A never-ending collection of potentially useful tools.
This collection is very much a work in progress type thing and is updated as I find new things that may be of use, or I learn new methods of achieving a result.
If you have any suggestions or fixes, feel free to share em however you see fit.

### Usage
`using BT;`

Then, when you want to call a function from ToolFunctions.cs, use:
```cs
BaneTools.FunctionHere();
BaneMath.FunctionHere();
BaneRays.FunctionHere();
```
There's also many extensions you can try, such as:
```cs
transform.CanSee(target);
muzzle.RayForward(range);
myScore.WithinRange(rangeLow, rangeHigh);
```
